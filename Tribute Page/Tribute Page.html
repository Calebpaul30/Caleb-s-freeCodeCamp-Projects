          <h2 id="beginning">She meant everything to me</h2>
          <p class="first-p">
            When she came into my life, she could literally fit in the palm of
            my hand. I still remember picking her up for the first time and
            holding her. She wouldn't stop licking my face. Its like we were
            meant for each other. She made me feel like I wasn't so alone. I
            loved her like she was my child. For 3 years, I was her entire
            world, and she was mine... or so i thought.

          <p>
          The biggest regret of my life was choosing to leave South Carolina to
          chase a female. In doing so, I inadvertently put this other girl first,
          and Nova second. Nova was the one that was always there for me, no
          matter what. That was almost 2 years ago, and I still hate
          myself. I can barely stand to look at myself in the mirror. I was the
          worst. You deserved better than me. Im so sorry.
